Real Estate and House Price Prediction – Bangladesh
This repository contains a Python-based machine learning project for predicting house prices in Bangladesh using real estate data. The notebook uses a dataset (house_price_bd.csv) with details about properties such as size, location, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, and price.

The model is built using XGBoost Regression and other preprocessing techniques to analyze and predict housing prices.
